# 3 Doors
You are a contestant on a game show. A prize is behind door 1, 2, or 3.  You make a guess as to which door has the prize behind it. The game-show host then opens one of the doors you did not choose and shows you that the prize is not there. The host gives you the option to change to your selection to the door you did not choose.
